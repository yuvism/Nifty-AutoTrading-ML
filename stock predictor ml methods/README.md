This repository is a result of me brainstorming some ideas using Machine Learning to try
and accurately predict the stock prices.
I have tried to employ many techniques, many of which worked and many of which didn't.
For my current trading strategy, refer to the history_repeats repository, which is maintained 
separately. It involves k-NN based model, combined with a momentum-trading strategy.

The machine learning techniques primarily used in this repository:
1. LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Models) on various time-series patterns.
2. k-Nearest Neighbours for both Classification and Regression.
3. Support Vector Machines for both Classification and Regression.
4. Deep Neural Networks for regression.
5. Some Deep Reinforcement Learning based techniques (research paper from Columbia University).
6. Decision Trees for both Classification and Regression.

Often, these are added as combined Brainstorming Python notebooks. The key takeaways have 
been shared in my other repository. I will keep on updating these Brainstorming notebooks
from time-to-time!

Any ideas to incorporate in them are welcome!
